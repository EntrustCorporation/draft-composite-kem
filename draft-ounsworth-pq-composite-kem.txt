                 Composite KEM For Use In Internet PKI
                  draft-ounsworth-pq-composite-kem-00

Abstract

   With the widespread adoption of post-quantum cryptography will come
   the need for an entity to possess multiple public keys on different
   cryptographic algorithms.  Since the trustworthiness of individual
   post-quantum algorithms is at question, a multi-key cryptographic
   operation will need to be performed in such a way that breaking it
   requires breaking each of the component algorithms individually.
   This requires defining new procedures for key encapsulation.

   This document defines a Composite key encapsulation mechanism (KEM)
   procedure, for use with Composite keys which consist of combinations
   of Encryption or KEM algorithms for each composite component
   algorithm.

   This document is intended to be coupled with the composite keys
   structure define in [draft-ounsworth-pq-composite-keys-01] and the
   CMS KEM-TRANS mechanism in [draft-perret-prat-lamps-cms-pq-kem-00].

1.  Introduction

   During the transition to post-quantum cryptography, there will be
   uncertainty as to the strength of cryptographic algorithms; we will
   no longer fully trust traditional cryptography such as RSA, Diffie-
   Hellman, DSA and their elliptic curve variants, but we will also not
   fully trust their post-quantum replacements until they have had
   sufficient scrutiny and time to discover and fix implementation bugs.
   Unlike previous cryptographic algorithm migrations, the choice of
   when to migrate and which algorithms to migrate to, is not so clear.
   Even after the migration period, it may be advantageous for an
   entity's cryptographic identity to be composed of multiple public-key
   algorithms.

   The deployment of composite public keys, and composite signatures and
   composite encryption using post-quantum algorithms will face two
   challenges

   o  Algorithm strength uncertainty: During the transition period, some
      post-quantum signature and encryption algorithms will not be fully
      trusted, while also the trust in legacy public key algorithms will
      start to erode.  A relying party may learn some time after
      deployment that a public key algorithm has become untrustworthy,
      but in the interim, they may not know which algorithm an adversary
      has compromised.

   o  Migration: During the transition period, systems will require
      mechanisms that allow for staged migrations from fully classical
      to fully post-quantum-aware cryptography.

   This document provides a mechanism to address algorithm strength
   uncertainty by building on [draft-ounsworth-pq-composite-keys-00]
   (NOTE: need kramdown formatting help with this ref) by providing the
   format and process for combining multiple cryptographic algorithms
   into a single key encapsulation operation.  Backwards compatibility
   is addressed via using composite in conjunction with a non-composite
   hybrid mode such as that described in [draft-becker-guthrie-
   noncomposite-hybrid-auth-00] (NOTE: need kramdown formatting help
   with this ref).

   This document is intended for general applicability anywhere that key
   establishment or enveloped content encryption is used within PKIX or
   CMS structures.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The following terms are used in this document:

   ALGORITHM: An information object class for identifying the type of
   cryptographic key being encapsulated.

   BER: Basic Encoding Rules (BER) as defined in [X.690].

   CLIENT: Any software that is making use of a key at runtime.  This
   includes a signer, verifyir, encryptor, decryptor.

   COMBINER MODE: A combiner mode specifies how keys are to be combined
   together into a single cryptographic operation.  Examples include
   AND, OR, K-of-N.  Specifications of composite signature or encryption
   proceedures will need to specify the behaviour under each mode.

   COMPONENT ALGORITHM: A single basic algorithm which is contained
   within a composite algorithm.

   COMPOSITE ALGORITHM: An algorithm which is a sequence of two or more
   component algorithms.

   DER: Distinguished Encoding Rules as defined in [X.690].

   KEM: A key encapsulation mechanism as defined in Section 2.1.

   PUBLIC / PRIVATE KEY: The public and private portion of an asymmetric
   cryptographic key, making no assumptions about which algorithm.

   SHARED SECRET: A value established between two communicating parties
   by means of a cryptographic operation, but which cannot be learned by
   an active or passive adversary.

2.  Composite KEM Structures

2.1.  Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs)

   We borrow here the definition of a key encapsulation mecanism (KEM)
   from [I-D.draft-ietf-tls-hybrid-design], in which a KEM consists of
   three algorithms:

Internet-Draft              PQ Composite Keys                   May 2022


   o  KeyGen() -> (pk, sk): A probabilistic key generation algorithm,
      which generates a public key pk and a secret key sk.

   o  Encaps(pk) -> (ct, ss): A probabilistic encapsulation algorithm,
      which takes as input a public key pk and outputs a ciphertext ct
      and shared secret ss.

   o  Decaps(sk, ct) -> ss: A decapsulation algorithm, which takes as
      input a secret key sk and ciphertext ct and outputs a shared
      secret ss, or in some cases a distinguished error value.

   This document is not concerned with the KeyGen() algorithm of a KEM,
   but it is included for completeness.

   The KEM interface defined above differs from both tradational key
   transport mechanism (for example for use with KeyTransRecipientInfo
   defined in [RFC5652]), and key agreement (for example for use with
   KeyAgreeRecipientInfo defined in [RFC5652]).

   The KEM interface was chosen as the interface for a composite key
   exchange because both key transport and key agreement mechanisms can
   be promoted into KEMs in the following ways:

   A key transport mechanism can be promoted into a KEM.Encaps(pk) by
   generating a random shared secret ss and performing
   KeyTrans.Encrypt(pk, ss) -P ct; and into a KEM.Decaps(sk, ct) by
   KeyTrans.Decrypt(sk, ct) -> ss.  This follows the pattern of RSA-KEM
   [RFC5990].

   A key agreement mechanism can be promoted into a KEM.Encaps(pk) by
   generating an ephemeral key pair (pk_e, sk_e), and performing
   KeyAgree(pk, sk_e) -> (ss, pk_e); and into a KEM.Decaps(sk, ct) by
   completing the key agreement as KeyAgree(pk_e, sk) -> ss.

   A composite KEM allows two or more underlying key transport, key
   agreement, or KEM alogrithms to be combined into a single
   cryptographic operations by performing each operation, promoted to a
   KEM as outline above, and concatenating all component shared secrets
   into a single shared secret.

   The main security property for KEMs is indistinguishability under
   adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (IND-CCA2), which means that shared
   secret values should be indistinguishable from random strings even
   given the ability to have other arbitrary ciphertexts decapsulated.

   A weaker security notion is indistinguishability under chosen
   plaintext attack (IND-CPA), which means that the shared secret values
   should be indistinguishable from random strings given a copy of the

   public key.  IND-CPA roughly corresponds to security against a
   passive attacker, and sometimes corresponds to one-time key exchange.

   The composite KEM mechanisms meets these security properties if and
   only if the component primitives meet them.

   TODO: needs more formal analysis that the methods of promoting
   KeyTrans and KeyAgree meet this.

   TODO: QUESTION: If we return "SS = SS1 || .. || SSn", does that make
   this mechanism fail IND-CCA2?  Do we need to carry a KDF here too and
   do "SS = KDF(SS1 || .. || SSn)"?  Also take another look at
   Section 8.3 with regards to this question.

   When an octet string is required, the DER encoding of the composite

   When a bit string is required, the octets of the DER encoded
   composite data structure SHALL be used as the bits of the bit string,
   with the most significant bit of the first octet becoming the first
   bit, and so on, ending with the least significant bit of the last
   octet becoming the last bit of the bit string.

4.  Composite Key Encapsulation

   Composite key encapsulations takes a CompositePublicKey as its input.
   The CompositePublicKey MUST contain composite keys (Pi .. Pn) which
   represent an algorithm which is a KEM (Key Encapsulation Method), or
   an algorithm that contains encryption or decryption primitive.  For
   example (RSA).

   This operation outputs a shared-secret and cipher text.

   Input:  CompositePublicKey (PK1, PK2 .. PKn)

   Output:  SS, CT

          if PKi is of type KEM:
             SSi, CTi := encaps(PKi)

          else, if PKi is of type keyEncipherment:
            SSi := random_bits(SIZE)
            CTi := encrypt(SSi, PKi)

          else, if PKi is of type keyAgreement:
             PKe, SKe := keyGen()
             SSi := keyAgree(PKi, SKe)
             CTi := PKe


     2.  SS = SSi ||  SSn
         CT = CT1, CT2, .., CTn

5.  Composite Key Decapsulation

   Composite key decapsulations takes a CompositePrivateKey as its input
   and the sequence of Cipher texts (ct1 .. ctn) computed by the
   composite key encapsulation method.  The CompositePrivateKey MUST
   contain composite keys (Pi .. Pn) which represent an algorithm which
   is a KEM (Key Encapsulation Method), or an algorithm that contains
   encryption or decryption primitive.  These keys MUST consist of the
   same component keys in the same order as the Composite Key
   Encapsulation process that generated them.

   This operation outputs a shared-secret.

   Input:   CompositePrivateKey = SK1, SK2 .. SKn
             CT = CT1, CT2, .., CTn

   Output:  SS

   1. for i := 1 to n

         if SKi is of type KEM:
             SSi := decaps(Cti, SKi)

         else, if SKi is of type keyEncipherment:
             SSi := decrypt(Cti, SKi)

          else, if PKi is of type keyAgreement:
             PKe := decode(CTi)
             SSi := keyAgree(PKe, SKi)

   2. Output SS = SSi ||  SSn

5.1.  Composite KEM CipherText Encoding

   For ease of use when encoding and decoding, the following encoding is
   suggested for the CipherText.

   CompositeKemCT :: SEQUENCE SIZE (2..MAX) of OctetString

   This will allow implementations a simple and uniform way to
   distribute the set of Cipher texts required for the decapsulation
   process.
   It is not mandatory as an implementation could choose to store the
   set of Cipher texts produced in a different format, so long as they
   are available at time of decapsulation.

5.2.  Generic vs Explicit Variants

   TBD if we need to say anything, or if it's all covered already by the
   keys draft.

6.  In Practice

   This section addresses practical issues of how this draft affects
   other protocols and standards.

   EDNOTE 10: Possible topics to address:

   o  The size of these certs and cert chains.

   o  In particular, implications for (large) composite keys /
      signatures / certs on the handshake stages of TLS and IKEv2.

   o  If a cert in the chain is a composite cert then does the whole
      chain need to be of composite Certs?

   o  We could also explain that the root CA cert does not have to be of
      the same algorithms.  The root cert SHOULD NOT be transferred in
      the authentication exchange to save transport overhead and thus it
      can be different than the intermediate and leaf certs.

   o  We could talk about overhead (size and processing).

   o  We could also discuss backwards compatibility.

   o  We could include a subsection about implementation considerations.

7.  IANA Considerations

   The ASN.1 module OID is TBD.

8.  Security Considerations

8.1.  Policy for Deprecated and Acceptable Algorithms

   Traditionally, a public key, certificate, or signature contains a
   single cryptographic algorithm.  If and when an algorithm becomes
   deprecated (for example, RSA-512, or SHA1), it is obvious that
   structures using that algorithm are implicitly revoked.

   In the composite model this is less obvious since implementers may
   decide that certain cryptographic algorithms have complementary
   security properties and are acceptable in combination even though one
   or both algorithms are deprecated for individual use.  As such, a



Ounsworth & Gray        Expires November 11, 2022               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft              PQ Composite Keys                   May 2022


   single composite public key, certificate, signature, or ciphertext
   may contain a mixture of deprecated and non-deprecated algorithms.

   Specifying behaviour in these cases is beyond the scope of this
   document, but should be considered by implementors and potentially in
   addiniotal standards.

   EDNOTE: Max is working on a CRL mechanism to accomplish this.

8.2.  OR Modes

   TODO

8.3.  APOP Attack on concatenated keys

   See the attack analysis described in [Avirom2021].

   A possible fix, which aligns with [I-D.draft-ietf-tls-hybrid-design],
   would be to have all KEM algorithm definitions for use in CMS specify
   a fixed output length for the shared secret it produces, this would
   preclude attackers at runtime from manipulating the length of a
   shared secret so that the next one in the concatenation falls on a
   hash block boundary, which closes the attack mentioned above.

   A natural place to do this would be in [I-D.draft-turner-lamps-nist-
   pqc-kem-certificates].
