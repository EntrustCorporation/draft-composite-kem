                 Composite KEM For Use In Internet PKI
                  draft-ounsworth-pq-composite-kem-00

Abstract

   The migration to post-quantum cryptography is unique in the history
   of modern digital cryptography in that neither the old outgoing nor
   the new incoming algorithms are fully trusted to protect data for the
   required data lifetimes.  The outgoing algorithms, such as RSA and
   elliptic curve, may fall to quantum cryptalanysis, while the incoming
   post-quantum algorithms face uncertainty about both the underlying
   mathematics as well as hardware and software implementations that
   have not had sufficient maturing time to rule out classical
   cryptanalytic attacks and implementation bugs.

   Cautious implementors may wish to layer cryptographic algorithms such
   that an attacker would need to break all of them in order to
   compromise the data being protected.  For digital signatures, this is
   referred to as "dual", and for encryption key establishment this as
   reffered to as "hybrid".  This document, and its companions, defines
   a specific instantiation of the dual and hybrid paradigm called
   "composite" where multiple cryptographic algorithms are combined to
   form a single key, signature, or key encapsulation mechanism (KEM)
   such that they can be treated as a single atomic object at the
   protocol level.

   EDNOTE: the terms "dual" and "hybrid" are currently in flux.  We
   anticipate an Informational draft to normalize terminology, and will
   update this draft accordingly.

   This document defines a Composite key encapsulation mechanism (KEM)
   procedure, for use with Composite keys which consist of combinations
   of Encryption or KEM algorithms for each composite component
   algorithm.

   This document is intended to be coupled with the composite keys
   structure define in [I-D.ounsworth-pq-composite-keys] and the CMS
   KEM-TRANS mechanism in [I-D.perret-prat-lamps-cms-pq-kem].

1.  Introduction

   During the transition to post-quantum cryptography, there will be
   uncertainty as to the strength of cryptographic algorithms; we will
   no longer fully trust traditional cryptography such as RSA, Diffie-
   Hellman, DSA and their elliptic curve variants, while me may also not
   fully trust their post-quantum replacements until they have had
   sufficient scrutiny and time to discover and fix implementation bugs.
   Unlike previous cryptographic algorithm migrations, the choice of
   when to migrate and which algorithms to migrate to, is not so clear.
   Even after the migration period, it may be advantageous for an
   entity's cryptographic identity to be composed of multiple public-key
   algorithms.

   The deployment of composite public keys, and composite signatures and
   composite encryption using post-quantum algorithms will face two
   challenges

   o  Algorithm strength uncertainty: During the transition period, some
      post-quantum signature and encryption algorithms will not be fully
      trusted, while also the trust in legacy public key algorithms will
      start to erode.  A relying party may learn some time after
      deployment that a public key algorithm has become untrustworthy,
      but in the interim, they may not know which algorithm an adversary
      has compromised.

   o  Migration: During the transition period, systems will require
      mechanisms that allow for staged migrations from fully classical
      to fully post-quantum-aware cryptography.

   This document provides a mechanism to address algorithm strength
   uncertainty by building on [I-D.ounsworth-pq-composite-keys] (NOTE:
   need kramdown formatting help with this ref) by providing the format
   and process for combining multiple cryptographic algorithms into a
   single key encapsulation operation.  Backwards compatibility is
   addressed via using composite in conjunction with a non-composite
   hybrid mode such as that described in [draft-becker-guthrie-
   noncomposite-hybrid-auth-00] (NOTE: need kramdown formatting help
   with this ref).

   This document is intended for general applicability anywhere that key
   establishment or enveloped content encryption is used within PKIX or
   CMS structures.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The following terms are used in this document:

   ALGORITHM: An information object class for identifying the type of
   cryptographic key being encapsulated.

   BER: Basic Encoding Rules (BER) as defined in [X.690].

   CLIENT: Any software that is making use of a key at runtime.  This
   includes a signer, verifyir, encryptor, decryptor.

   COMBINER MODE: A combiner mode specifies how keys are to be combined
   together into a single cryptographic operation.  Examples include
   AND, OR, K-of-N.  Specifications of composite signature or encryption
   proceedures will need to specify the behaviour under each mode.

   COMPONENT ALGORITHM: A single basic algorithm which is contained
   within a composite algorithm.

   COMPOSITE ALGORITHM: An algorithm which is a sequence of two or more
   component algorithms.

   DER: Distinguished Encoding Rules as defined in [X.690].

   KEM: A key encapsulation mechanism as defined in Section 2.1.

Internet-Draft              PQ Composite Keys                  July 2022


   POST-QUANTUM AGLORITHM: Any cryptographic algorithm which is believed
   to be resistant to classical and quantum cryptanalysis, such as the
   algorithms being considered for standardization by NIST.

   PUBLIC / PRIVATE KEY: The public and private portion of an asymmetric
   cryptographic key, making no assumptions about which algorithm.

   SHARED SECRET: A value established between two communicating parties
   by means of a cryptographic operation, but which cannot be learned by
   an active or passive adversary.

2.  Composite KEM Structures

2.1.  Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs)

   We borrow here the definition of a key encapsulation mecanism (KEM)
   from [I-D.ietf-tls-hybrid-design], in which a KEM consists of three
   algorithms:

   o  KeyGen() -> (pk, sk): A probabilistic key generation algorithm,
      which generates a public key pk and a secret key sk.

   o  Encaps(pk) -> (ct, ss): A probabilistic encapsulation algorithm,
      which takes as input a public key pk and outputs a ciphertext ct
      and shared secret ss.

   o  Decaps(sk, ct) -> ss: A decapsulation algorithm, which takes as
      input a secret key sk and ciphertext ct and outputs a shared
      secret ss, or in some cases a distinguished error value.

   This document is not concerned with the KeyGen() algorithm of a KEM,
   but it is included for completeness.

   The KEM interface defined above differs from both tradational key
   transport mechanism (for example for use with KeyTransRecipientInfo
   defined in [RFC5652]), and key agreement (for example for use with
   KeyAgreeRecipientInfo defined in [RFC5652]).

   The KEM interface was chosen as the interface for a composite key
   exchange because both key transport and key agreement mechanisms can
   be promoted into KEMs in the following ways:

   A key transport mechanism can be transformed into a KEM.Encaps(pk) by
   generating a random shared secret ss and performing
   KeyTrans.Encrypt(pk, ss) -> ct; and into a KEM.Decaps(sk, ct) by
   KeyTrans.Decrypt(sk, ct) -> ss.  This follows the pattern of RSA-KEM
   [RFC5990].

Internet-Draft              PQ Composite Keys                  July 2022


   A key agreement mechanism can be transformed into a KEM.Encaps(pk) by
   generating an ephemeral key pair (pk_e, sk_e), and performing
   KeyAgree(pk, sk_e) -> (ss, pk_e); and into a KEM.Decaps(sk, ct) by
   completing the key agreement as KeyAgree(pk_e, sk) -> ss.

   A composite KEM allows two or more underlying key transport, key
   agreement, or KEM algorithms to be combined into a single
   cryptographic operations by performing each operation, promoted to a
   KEM as outline above, and concatenating all component shared secrets
   into a single shared secret.

   The main security property for KEMs is indistinguishability under
   adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (IND-CCA2), which means that shared
   secret values should be indistinguishable from random strings even
   given the ability to have other arbitrary ciphertexts decapsulated.

   A weaker security notion is indistinguishability under chosen
   plaintext attack (IND-CPA), which means that the shared secret values
   should be indistinguishable from random strings given a copy of the
   public key.  IND-CPA roughly corresponds to security against a
   passive attacker, and sometimes corresponds to one-time key exchange.

   The shared secret MUST be indistinguishable under adaptive chosen
   ciphertext attacks (IND-CCA2), for example when it is the output of a
   KDF.

   The composite KEM mechanisms meets these security properties if and
   only if the component primitives meet them.

   TODO: needs more formal analysis that the methods of transforming
   KeyTrans and KeyAgree meet this.

   TODO: Discussed use of ASN.1 to combine the shared secrets.  ASN.1 is
   nice because it embedds the length values for us.

2.2.  Composite Keys

   A composite key is a single key object that performs an atomic
   cryptographic operation as defined in
   [I-D.ounsworth-pq-composite-keys].

2.2.1.  Key Usage Bits

   When using composite KEM keys in a structure which defines a key
   usage (such as in an X509Certificate as defined in RFC 5280), the
   following key usage MUST be used.

   keyEncipherment



Ounsworth & Gray        Expires January 10, 2023                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft              PQ Composite Keys                  July 2022


   Other types of key usages SHOULD not be used.  The main intent for
   this keyEncipherment is to encapsulate (encrypt) another key.  This
   is the main purpose of a KEM aglorithm, and composite-KEM does not
   deviate from this intent.

   EDNOTE: The main argument for using keyEncipherment verses
   keyAgreement is that multiple parties are required to contribute to a
   key agreement verses a single party in keyEncipherment.

   EDNOTE: It is recognized that KEMS will be added into other PKIX and
   X509 standards and these need to make the same choice about the key
   usage of a KEM key.

2.3.  CompositeCiphertextValue

   The compositeCipherTextValue is a concatenation of the Ciphter texts
   of the underlying component algorithms.  It is represented in ASN.1
   as follows:

   CompositeCiphertextValue ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (2..MAX) OF BIT STRING

2.4.  Encoding Rules

   Many protocol specifications will require that composite KEM data
   structures be represented by an octet string or bit string.

   When an octet string is required, the DER encoding of the composite
   data structure SHALL be used directly.

   EDNOTE: will this definition include an ASN.1 tag and length byte
   inside the OCTET STRING object?  If so, that's probably an extra
   uneccessary layer.

   When a bit string is required, the octets of the DER encoded
   composite data structure SHALL be used as the bits of the bit string,
   with the most significant bit of the first octet becoming the first
   bit, and so on, ending with the least significant bit of the last
   octet becoming the last bit of the bit string.

   In the interests of simplicity and avoiding compatibility issues,
   implementations that parse these structures MAY accept both BER and
   DER.

2.4.1.  Composite KEM CipherText Encoding

   For ease of use when encoding and decoding, the following encoding is
   suggested for the CipherText.

Internet-Draft              PQ Composite Keys                  July 2022


   CompositeKemCT :: SEQUENCE SIZE (2..MAX) of OctetString

   This will allow implementations a simple and uniform way to
   distribute the set of Cipher texts required for the decapsulation
   process.
   It is not mandatory as an implementation could choose to store the
   set of Cipher texts produced in a different format, so long as they
   are available at time of decapsulation.

   EDNOTE: is this section adding anything beyond what's already said in
   the section above?

3.  Algorithm Identifiers

   The following algorithm Identifiers and their associated parameters
   are used with composite KEM.

3.1.  id-alg-composite-kem

   The id-alg-composite-kem object identifier is used for identifying a
   generic composite KEM algorithm.  This allows arbitrary combinations
   of component key transport, key agreement and KEM algorithms without
   needing the combination to be pre-registered or pre-agreed.

      id-alg-composite-kem OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
       joint-iso-itu-t(2) country(16) us(840) organization(1)
       entrust(114027) Algorithm(80) Composite(4) KEM (5) }

   EDNOTE: this is a temporary OID for the purposes of prototyping.  We
   are requesting IANA to assign a permanent OID, see Section 6.

   Which yields an information object:

   TODO - Define a KEM-ALGORITHM - extension to RFC 5912 - Bring to IETF
   is kema (for KEM algorithm) the right prefix?

      kema-CompositeKEM KEM-ALGORITHM ::= {
          IDENTIFIER id-alg-composite-kem
          VALUE CompositeCiphertextValue
          PARAMS composite-kem-params
          PUBLIC-KEYS { pk-Composite }
          SMIME-CAPS { IDENTIFIED BY id-alg-composite } }
      }

   Composite KEM carries its algorithm parameters in the Parameters
   field of the AlgorithmIdentifier:

       AlgorithmIdentifier  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
           algorithm               OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
           parameters              ANY DEFINED BY algorithm OPTIONAL  }

   For Composite KEM, we define a composite KEM Algorithm ID as:

      compositeKEMalgID AlgorithmIdentifier  ::=  {
           algorithm       id-alg-composite-kem,
           parameters      composite-kem-params }

   The parameters in the compositeKemalgID are composite-kem-params

      composite-kem-params  ::=  SEQUENCE {
           kdf                  AlgorithmIdentifier,
      }

   ~~~ BEGIN EDNOTE ~~~

   If we want to allow for additional combiner modes, these combiner
   modes could be defined by an algorithm identifier containing the
   combiner mode, we would instead define composite-kem-params as:

      composite-kem-params  ::=  SEQUENCE {
           combiner     AlgorithmIdentifier,
      }

   We would then define the following combiner:

   Example:

      combiner AlgorithmIdentifier  ::=  {
           algorithm       id-Composite-KDF-Combiner,
           parameters      alg-Composite-KDF-Combiner-Params }

   id-Composite-KDF-Combiner ::== OBJECT_IDENTIFIER

   alg-Composite-KDF-Combiner-Params ::= AlgorithmIdentifier

   where:

   id-Composite-KDF-Combiner is the OBJECT IDENTIFIER for the combiner

   alg-Composite-KDF-Combiner-Params ::= AlgorithmIdentifier

   to specify the KDF (Option 2 below ednote) to use in the construction
   "SS = KDF( KDF(SS1) || KDF(SS2) || .. || KDF(SSn) )".

   If no parameters are supplied, then the default combiner mode could
   be simple concatenation as per NIST SP 800-56Cr2

   SS =  SSi || SSn

4.  Composite Key Encapsulation

   Composite key encapsulations takes a CompositePublicKey as its input.
   The CompositePublicKey MUST contain composite keys (Pi .. Pn) which
   represent an algorithm which is a KEM (Key Encapsulation Method), or
   an algorithm that contains encryption or decryption primitive.  For
   example (RSA).

   This operation outputs a shared-secret and cipher text.

   COMBINER is a function used to combine multiple shared secrets

   Input:  CompositePublicKey (PK1, PK2 .. PKn)
           COMBINER

   Output:  SS, CT

          if PKi is of type KEM:
             SSi, CTi := encaps(PKi)

          else, if PKi is of type keyEncipherment:
            SSi := random_bits(SIZE)
            CTi := encrypt(SSi, PKi)

          else, if PKi is of type keyAgreement:
             PKe, SKe := keyGen()
             SSi := keyAgree(PKi, SKe)
             CTi := PKe

5.  Composite Key Decapsulation

   Composite key decapsulations takes a CompositePrivateKey as its input
   and the sequence of Cipher texts (ct1 .. ctn) computed by the
   composite key encapsulation method.  The CompositePrivateKey MUST
   contain composite keys (Pi .. Pn) which represent an algorithm which
   is a KEM (Key Encapsulation Method), or an algorithm that contains
   encryption or decryption primitive.  These keys MUST consist of the
   same component keys in the same order as the Composite Key
   Encapsulation process that generated them.

   This operation outputs a shared-secret.

   COMBINER is a function used to combine multiple shared secrets

   Input:   CompositePrivateKey = SK1, SK2 .. SKn
            CT = CT1, CT2, .., CTn
            COMBINER


   Output:  SS

   1. for i := 1 to n

         if SKi is of type KEM:
             SSi := decaps(Cti, SKi)

         else, if SKi is of type keyEncipherment:
             SSi := decrypt(Cti, SKi)

          else, if PKi is of type keyAgreement:
             PKe := decode(CTi)
             SSi := keyAgree(PKe, SKi)

   2. Output SS =  SS = COMBINER(SSi..SSn)

   "SS = KDF(SS1) XOR KDF(SS2) XOR .. XOR KDF(SSn)"

   Option 3)

   The combiner suggested in [Aviram2022].

   At present we are opting for Option 2.

   QUESTION: Should the choice of combiner be assigned an OID and made
   agile?  If not, then we perhaps we need a version field within the
   composite kem structure to allow for future agility.

   ~~~ END EDNOTE ~~~

   EDNOTE: We we need domain separation in case other protocols use the
   same shared secrets in the same construction?  Something like "KDF(
   ASCII("compositeKEM") || KDF(input1) || KDF(input2) )" ?

6.  In Practice

   This section addresses practical issues of how this draft affects
   other protocols and standards.

   EDNOTE 10: Possible topics to address:

   o  The size of these certs and cert chains.

   o  In particular, implications for (large) composite keys /
      signatures / certs on the handshake stages of TLS and IKEv2.

   o  If a cert in the chain is a composite cert then does the whole
      chain need to be of composite Certs?

   o  We could also explain that the root CA cert does not have to be of
      the same algorithms.  The root cert SHOULD NOT be transferred in
      the authentication exchange to save transport overhead and thus it
      can be different than the intermediate and leaf certs.

   o  We could talk about overhead (size and processing).

   o  We could also discuss backwards compatibility.

   o  We could include a subsection about implementation considerations.

7.  IANA Considerations

   The ASN.1 module OID is TBD.

8.  Security Considerations

8.1.  Policy for Deprecated and Acceptable Algorithms

   Traditionally, a public key, certificate, or signature contains a
   single cryptographic algorithm.  If and when an algorithm becomes
   deprecated (for example, RSA-512, or SHA1), it is obvious that
   structures using that algorithm are implicitly revoked.

   In the composite model this is less obvious since implementers may
   decide that certain cryptographic algorithms have complementary
   security properties and are acceptable in combination even though one
   or both algorithms are deprecated for individual use.  As such, a
   single composite public key, certificate, signature, or ciphertext
   may contain a mixture of deprecated and non-deprecated algorithms.

   Specifying behaviour in these cases is beyond the scope of this
   document, but should be considered by implementors and potentially in
   addiniotal standards.

   EDNOTE: Max is working on a CRL mechanism to accomplish this.

8.2.  OR Modes

   TODO

8.3.  Cryptographic review of combiner

   EDNOTE: LAMPS should probably request CFRF review of this draft to
   ensure that the combiner is resistant to all known cryptograhpic
   attacks.

8.3.1.  Need for a KDF within the combiner

   It is expected that the majority of uses of the KEM defined in this
   document will be within a construct such as
   [I-D.perret-prat-lamps-cms-pq-kem] which supplies the KEM output to a
   KDF in order to derive a wrapping key.  In these cases it is



Ounsworth & Gray        Expires January 10, 2023               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft              PQ Composite Keys                  July 2022


   redundant for the combiner within the composite KEM to also use a
   KDF.  However, it is possible for protocol designers to want to use a
   KEM output -- or a truncation of it -- directly as a symmetric key;
   for this purpose we have included a KDF in the composite KEM
   construction.

   In protocols where the KEM output will be supplied to a KDF, it
   should be safe to use a NULL KDF within the composite KEM -- ie the
   KDF where "KDF(m) = m" -- but we leave the details of any such
   security analysis to the protocol designers who wish to implement it.

8.3.2.  APOP Attack on concatenated keys

   See the attack analysis described in summary in [Aviram2021].

   The pre-conditions for the described attack are quite strong: namely
   that the attacker has full control of both the content and length of
   the first shared secret in the combiner, and that the attacker can
   perform collision attacks against the underlying KDF.

   We believe that, in general, neither of these pre-conditions are met
   within PKIX protocols.  First, any key transport, key agreement, or
   KEM primitive approved for use within PKIX sets a fixed length for
   the shared secret that it produces so that the attacker cannot change
   the shared secret length between subsequent runs of the same
   protocol.  This justification aligns with the justification used for
   [I-D.draft-ietf-tls-hybrid-design].  Second, any non-depricated KDF
   will not allow collision attacks.

   In addition, the combiner construction defined in this document aims
   to provide additional collision resistance on top of that provided by
   the underlying KDF.

8.3.3.  Aviram2022

   See the attack analysis described in summary in [Aviram2022].

   This paper is largely critiquing the use of HKDF (HMAC) as a dual-PRF
   combiner for two secrets.  This is not exactly what we are doing
   here.

   [Aviram2022] gives the following definition: "If we would like to
   combine two keys, either of which might be influenced by an attacker,
   we need adual-PRF as the keycombiner: That is, a function which is a
   PRF when keyed by either input.

   We believe the construction offered in this document meets this
   definition of a dual-PRF so long as the chosen KDF is itself a PRF.

   This holds even if the chosen KDF is HKDF with the same key (salt)
   used in each KDF() operation.
